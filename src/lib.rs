//! # Interop between Metal and [`raw-window-handle`]
//!
//! Helpers for constructing a [`CAMetalLayer`] from a handle given by [`raw-window-handle`]. See
//! the [`Layer`] type for the full API.
//!
//! [`raw-window-handle`]: https://crates.io/crates/raw-window-handle
//!
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Create a layer from a window that implements [`HasWindowHandle`].
//!
//! ```
//! use objc2::rc::Retained;
//! use objc2_quartz_core::CAMetalLayer;
//! use raw_window_handle::{RawWindowHandle, HasWindowHandle};
//! use raw_window_metal::Layer;
//! #
//! # let mtm = objc2_foundation::MainThreadMarker::new().expect("doc tests to run on main thread");
//! #
//! # #[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
//! # let view = unsafe { objc2_app_kit::NSView::new(mtm) };
//! # #[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
//! # let handle = RawWindowHandle::AppKit(raw_window_handle::AppKitWindowHandle::new(std::ptr::NonNull::from(&*view).cast()));
//! #
//! # #[cfg(not(target_os = "macos"))]
//! # let view = unsafe { objc2_ui_kit::UIView::new(mtm) };
//! # #[cfg(not(target_os = "macos"))]
//! # let handle = RawWindowHandle::UiKit(raw_window_handle::UiKitWindowHandle::new(std::ptr::NonNull::from(&*view).cast()));
//! # let window = unsafe { raw_window_handle::WindowHandle::borrow_raw(handle) };
//!
//! let layer = match window.window_handle().expect("handle available").as_raw() {
//!     // SAFETY: The handle is a valid `NSView` because it came from `WindowHandle<'_>`.
//!     RawWindowHandle::AppKit(handle) => unsafe { Layer::from_ns_view(handle.ns_view) },
//!     // SAFETY: The handle is a valid `UIView` because it came from `WindowHandle<'_>`.
//!     RawWindowHandle::UiKit(handle) => unsafe { Layer::from_ui_view(handle.ui_view) },
//!     _ => panic!("unsupported handle"),
//! };
//! let layer: *mut CAMetalLayer = layer.into_raw().cast();
//! // SAFETY: The pointer is a valid `CAMetalLayer` with +1 retain count.
//! let layer = unsafe { Retained::from_raw(layer).unwrap() };
//!
//! // Use `CAMetalLayer` here.
//! ```

//!
//!
//! ## Semantics
//!
//! As the user of this crate, you are likely creating a library yourself, and need to interface
//! with a layer provided by a windowing library like Winit or SDL.
//!
//! In that sense, when the user hands your library a view or a layer via. `raw-window-handle`, they
//! likely expect you to render into it. You should freely do that, but you should refrain from
//! doing things like resizing the layer by changing its `bounds`, changing its `contentsGravity`,
//! `opacity`, and similar such properties; semantically, these are things that are "outside" of
//! your library's control, and interferes with the platforms normal handling of such things (i.e.
//! the user creating a `MTKView`, and placing it inside a `NSStackView`. In such cases, you should
//! not change the bounds of the view, as that will be done automatically at a "higher" level).
//!
//! Properties specific to `CAMetalLayer` like `drawableSize`, `colorspace` and so on probably _are_
//! fine to change, because these are properties that the user _expects_ your library to change when
//! they've given it to you (and they won't be changed by e.g. the layer being inside a stack view).
//!
//!
//! ## Reasoning behind creating a sublayer
//!
//! If a view does not have a `CAMetalLayer` as the root layer (as is the default for most views),
//! then we're in a bit of a tricky position! We cannot use the existing layer with Metal, so we
//! must do something else. There are a few options:
//!
//! 1. Panic, and require the user to pass a view with a `CAMetalLayer` layer.
//!
//!    While this would "work", it doesn't solve the problem, and instead passes the ball onwards to
//!    the user and ecosystem to figure it out.
//!
//! 2. Override the existing layer with a newly created layer.
//!
//!    If we overlook that this does not work in UIKit since `UIView`'s `layer` is `readonly`, and
//!    that as such we will need to do something different there anyhow, this is actually a fairly
//!    good solution, and was what the original implementation did.
//!
//!    It has some problems though, due to:
//!
//!    a. Consumers of `raw-window-metal` like Wgpu and Ash in their API design choosing not to
//!       register a callback with `-[CALayerDelegate displayLayer:]`, but instead leaves it up to
//!       the user to figure out when to redraw. That is, they rely on other libraries' callbacks
//!       telling them when to render.
//!
//!       (If you were to make an API only for Metal, you would probably make the user provide a
//!       `render` closure that'd be called in the right situations).
//!
//!    b. Overwriting the `layer` on `NSView` makes the view "layer-hosting", see [wantsLayer],
//!       which disables drawing functionality on the view like `drawRect:`/`updateLayer`.
//!
//!    These two in combination makes it basically impossible for crates like Winit to provide a
//!    robust rendering callback that integrates with the system's built-in mechanisms for
//!    redrawing, exactly because overwriting the layer would be disabling those mechanisms!
//!
//!    [wantsLayer]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/1483695-wantslayer?language=objc
//!
//! 3. Create a sublayer.
//!
//!    `CALayer` has the concept of "sublayers", which we can use instead of overriding the layer.
//!
//!    This is also the recommended solution on UIKit, so it's nice that we can use the same
//!    implementation regardless of operating system.
//!
//!    It _might_, however, perform ever so slightly worse than overriding the layer directly.
//!
//! 4. Create a new `MTKView` (or a custom view), and add it as a subview.
//!
//!    Similar to creating a sublayer (see above), but also provides a bunch of event handling that
//!    we don't need.
//!
//! Option 3 seems like the most robust solution, so this is what this crate does.
//!
//! Now we have another problem though: The `bounds` and `contentsScale` of sublayers are not
//! automatically updated from the super layer.
//!
//! We could again choose to let that be up to the user of our crate, but that would be very
//! cumbersome. Instead, this crate registers the necessary observers to make the sublayer track the
//! size and scale factor of its super layer automatically. This makes it extra important that you
//! do not modify common `CALayer` properties of the layer that `raw-window-metal` creates, since
//! they may just end up being overwritten (see also "Semantics" above).
